# I-Am-Rich
Learning the basics of Swift iOS development
This app is inspired by the infamous "I Am Rich" application which cost 999.99 on the appstore, which essentially had no functionality.
The purpose of this app was to showcase the wealth of the user because they bought a useless app for a large sum of money.
